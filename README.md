# PA_Tasks
Tasks for the Parallel Algorithms subject VSB TUO.

## How to run:

The next dependencies are erquired to run in Python (taken from the pip freeze command).
Also, the repo does not contain the datasets and .txt files, so they have to be included in the directory value as such:
- Y-10_t.txt for task 1
- Datasets for the task 2
- Graph for task 3

Running the command: "pip install -r requirements.txt" should isntall the dependncies automatically.
All the programs are in a single file within its corresponding forlder and are called main.
